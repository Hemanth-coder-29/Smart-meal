# 🍽️ SmartMeal – AI-Powered Recipe & Meal Planning Platform

[![GitHub repo](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Hemanth-coder-29/Smart(https://github.com/Heman

## Overview

**SmartMeal** is a modern, open-source web application for discovering and planning meals using advanced recipe search, ingredient filtering, and dietary personalization. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and a standardized JSON database, it provides instant recipe recommendations tailored to your preferences and available ingredients.

***

## 🛠️ Project Structure

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/API:** Next.js API Routes (async, non-blocking), custom search logic
- **Data:** recipes stored as normalized JSON in `/public/data/recipes.json`
- **Logging & Debug:** Custom debug utility with color-coded logs and error boundaries
- **Core Features:**
  - Ingredient-based recipe search with match scoring
  - Dietary and cuisine filtering (Vegetarian, Vegan, Keto, etc.)
  - Sort by best match, quickest, easiest
  - AI/fuzzy matching of ingredient names
  - Recipe detail view and similar recipe recommendations
  - Robust error handling and developer-debug mode

***

## ⚡ How It Works

SmartMeal’s modular architecture:

1. **Input Layer:** User enters ingredients and selects dietary needs via a clean UI.
2. **Search/Filter:** The API matches recipes by ingredient overlap, dietary tags, and cuisine type.
3. **Smart Ranking:** Recipes are sorted by match score, total time, and difficulty.
4. **Details & Recommendations:** Users can see details, missing ingredients, and get similar recipe suggestions.

## ✨ Notable Features

- **Ingredient Matching:** Enter any combination of ingredients, see recipes sorted by best match.
- **Filters:** Instantly filter by cuisine or dietary needs (multi-select).
- **Fuzzy Matching:** User-friendly for typos and ingredient variants.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages, robust against missing/invalid input, offline mode.
- **Debug Tools:** Includes debug logs, error boundaries, and a debugging strategy for maintainability.

***

## 🧑‍💻 For Developers/Teachers

- **Code is fully typed (TypeScript) and structured for clarity.**
- **Logging and error handling are built-in for reliability and maintainability.**
- **JSON data can be extended for more recipes, and new dietary/cuisine filters can be added easily.**
- **See `/docs/` for implementation notes, debugging guides, and future improvement ideas.**
